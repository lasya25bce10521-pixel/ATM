Problem Statement

Managing basic banking activities such as cash withdrawal, deposits, and balance checks usually requires visiting an ATM machine. However, building a simplified ATM simulation helps users understand core banking logic, secure authentication, and transaction management.
The purpose of this project is to develop a console-based ATM system in Python that allows users to perform essential financial operations securely and efficiently. The system verifies users through account number and PIN authentication and enables simulated banking functionality within a controlled environment.


 Scope of the Projec:-t

The project focuses on implementing a basic banking ATM model using Python.

It covers user authentication, balance management, deposit/withdrawal functions, and transaction history.

The system uses simple file storage / dictionary storage to maintain and update user account information.

Suitable for academic learning, Python beginners, and mini-project submissions.

Can be further expanded with advanced features like GUI, multiple accounts, or database integration.
