# ATM
USING PYTHON
Project Overview

This project is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation system developed using Python. It aims to demonstrate core banking functionalities such as user authentication, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and transaction history tracking. The system runs in a console environment and mimics real ATM operations by interacting with stored user account data.

The main objectives of this project are:

a)To understand file handling / database storage for user data
b)To learn object-oriented programming concepts in Python
c)To implement real-time transaction handling logic
d)To create a secure login mechanism with PIN verification


This project can be used as a mini-project for B.Tech / B.E CSE, IT, and Diploma students or anyone learning Python fundamentals.

Features:-

a) Secure Login using account number & PIN
b) Check Account Balance
c) Withdraw Cash
d) Deposit Amount
e) View Transaction History
f) Exit System safely
